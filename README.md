# Virtual RobotX (VRX)
This repository is the home to the source code and software documentation for the VRX simulation environment, which supports simulation of unmanned surface vehicles in marine environments.
* Designed in coordination with RobotX organizers, this project provides arenas and tasks similar to those featured in past and future RobotX competitions, as well as a description of the WAM-V platform.
* For RobotX competitors this simulation environment is intended as a first step toward developing tools prototyping solutions in advance of physical on-water testing.
* We also welcome users with simulation needs beyond RobotX. As we continue to improve the environment, we hope to offer support to a wide range of potential applications.

## A new modernization development: Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy

> [!NOTE]
> This development effort was executed by the
> [Honu Robotics](https://honurobotics.com) team, thanks to the sponsorship
> of [RoboNation](https://robonation.org/).

We are happy to announce that the repository has been ported to use supported
versions of Gazebo and ROS 2:
  * Code is now working with Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy
  * This is the recommended configuration for new users.
  * Users who wish to continue running Gazebo Garden and ROS 2 Humble can still do so using the `humble` branch of this repository.

## The VRX Competition
The VRX environment is also the "virtual venue" for the [VRX Competition](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki). Please see our Wiki for tutorials and links to registration and documentation relevant to the virtual competition.

## Getting Started

 * Watch the [Release 2.3 Highlight Video](https://vimeo.com/851696025).
 * The [VRX Wiki](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki) provides documentation and tutorials.
 * The instructions assume a basic familiarity with the ROS environment and Gazebo.  If these tools are new to you, we recommend starting with the excellent [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
 * For technical problems, please use the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/issues) to describe your problem or request support.
